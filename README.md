# Step 1: Creating and Setting Up a JotForm
Sign Up/Login to JotForm: If you don’t have an account, create one at JotForm's website.
Create a New Form: Go to the JotForm dashboard, click on "Create Form" and choose the type of form you need.
Design Your Form: Add the necessary fields that you want to capture data for. Make sure these fields align with the data structure in your Airtable base.
Set Up Form Pre-filling (Optional): If needed, use JotForm's tools to pre-fill parts of your form based on previous interactions or known data.
# Step 2: Integrating JotForm with Airtable
Go to the 'Integrations' Panel: In your form editor, click on 'Settings', then select 'Integrations'.
Find and Select Airtable: Search for Airtable and select it to integrate.
Configure Airtable Integration: Follow the prompts to connect your Airtable account and choose the specific base and table where you want to send the form data.
# Step 3: Setting Up Webhooks in JotForm
Access Webhooks Integration: In the 'Integrations' panel, find and select 'Webhooks'.
Provide the Endpoint URL: Enter the URL where you want JotForm to send the data. This will be your server's endpoint (e.g., http://yourserver.com/inspectionform).
# Step 4: Understanding and Utilizing the app.js Code
Setting Up Environment Variables: Learn to use environment variables for storing sensitive information like API keys. Store these in a .env file and access them using process.env.VARIABLE_NAME.
Using Express and Body Parser: Understand how Express.js works as a web application framework. Learn to use body-parser to parse incoming request bodies in middleware.
Setting Up Routes and Middleware: Grasp how to define routes in Express. For the webhook, use app.post('/inspectionform', ...).
Handling File Uploads with Multer: Multer is used for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files.
# Step 5: Processing Data and Integrating with Airtable
Understanding airtableHandler.js: This file contains functions to process data and interact with Airtable.
Process JotForm Data: Learn to parse the received data and use the functions defined in airtableHandler.js to insert data into Airtable.
# Step 6: Setting Up Scheduled Tasks with reminderScheduler.js
Learn Cron Scheduling: Understand the cron syntax to schedule tasks.
Setting Up Tasks: Use cron.schedule to define various tasks like sending reminders or checking inspection dates.
# Step 7: Running the Application
Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install required packages.
Start the Server: Use node app.js to start the server. Ensure it’s running when you test the JotForm submission.

Additional Notes:
Error Handling: Learn to implement proper error handling for robust applications.
Debugging: Practice debugging by checking logs and using debugging tools.
By following these steps, your employee should be able to set up the system and understand the basics of integrating JotForm with Airtable using JavaScript. Encourage them to refer to documentation and online resources for in-depth understanding.
